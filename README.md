# order-extract
This is meant to extract the grauity and other key information from event checks
that are typically used in Marriott hotels for their catering events.

This simple script takes in the event check(pdf) and the template for the gratuity sheet (excel)
and extracts the Event Order Number, Date, and Gratuity Amount. It then separates all the data by date
and places the information in its proper place in the excel spreadsheet.
